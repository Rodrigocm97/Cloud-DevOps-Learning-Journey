# Cloud-DevOps-Learning-Journey
This repository documents my structured 3‑month study plan to transition from Telecommunications into Cloud Engineering and DevOps.   It includes notes, hands‑on labs, and projects that showcase my progress in cloud infrastructure, automation, and modern DevOps practices.
## Objectives
- Build solid foundations in Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Learn and apply DevOps tools (CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform).
- Document hands‑on projects and labs for public visibility.
- Prepare for Cloud/DevOps interviews with technical notes and practice.
- Update my CV and LinkedIn with quantifiable achievements.

## Day 1 – Fundamentals
- Definition of Cloud Computing.
- On‑premise vs Cloud comparison.
- Service models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
- Deployment models: Public, Private, Hybrid, Multi‑Cloud.
- Overview of major providers: AWS, Azure, GCP.
- First hands‑on: created a free cloud account and explored Compute, Storage, IAM, and Networking.

## Next Steps
- Day 2: Security basics in the cloud + Linux essentials.
- Day 3: Migrating a simple application to the cloud + Docker introduction.
